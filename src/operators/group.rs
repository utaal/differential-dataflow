//! Group records by a key, and apply a reduction function.
//!
//! The `group` operators act on data that can be viewed as pairs `(key, val)`. They group records
//! with the same key, and apply user supplied functions to the key and a list of values, which are
//! expected to populate a list of output values.
//!
//! Several variants of `group` exist which allow more precise control over how grouping is done.
//! For example, the `_by` suffixed variants take arbitrary data, but require a key-value selector
//! to be applied to each record. The `_u` suffixed variants use unsigned integers as keys, and
//! will use a dense array rather than a `HashMap` to store their keys.
//!
//! The list of values are presented as an iterator which internally merges sorted lists of values.
//! This ordering can be exploited in several cases to avoid computation when only the first few
//! elements are required.
